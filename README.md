## **Java Development Internship Projects**

## **About the Internship**

This repository contains the projects I have worked on during my internship in Java development at **OASIS INFOBYTE**. Throughout the internship, improving my skills in problem-solving, coding practices, and application design. 

My work included completing given tasks, designing and implementing different modules, handling various Java frameworks. The projects in this repository reflect the learning outcomes, including key concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), JDBC, etc.

## Projects

The repository includes several projects that were part of my internship. Below is a brief overview of the key projects:

## **1. ATM Interface** ##
It is a console based application that simulates an ATM interface, providing core banking functionalities.
The system allows user registration and login, authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposits, money transfer functionalities.
  ### Features :
  - **Admin Module :** Admin can view all users, search user by id, register a new user, and delete an existing user.
  - **User Registration & Login :** Users can register and create a new account and securely log in using their credentials.
  - **Authentication :** The system verifies the userâ€™s identity for secure access to their account.
  - **Balance Inquiry :** Users can check their current account balance.
  - **Cash Withdrawal :** Users can withdraw money from their account.
  - **Deposit :** Users can deposit money into their account.
  - **Money Transfer :** Users can transfer money between accounts.
  - **Transaction History :** Users can check their transaction history.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in Java such as file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and basic banking functionalities.

## **2. Number Guessing Game** ## 
It is a simple Java-based game where the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.
The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct and also assigns points.
  ### Features : 
  - The system generates a random number in the range of 1 to 100.
  - The user guesses the number, and the system gives feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
  - A limited number of attempts (10 attempts).
  - Option to play multiple rounds.
  - Displays the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
  - Assigns a score based on number of attempts.

This project is a great way to practice basic Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Learning Outcomes

During this internship, I have had the opportunity to:

- Strengthen my Java programming skills through practical applications.
- Learn about software development methodologies and best practices.
- Collaborate with mentors to solve complex coding challenges.
- Gain hands-on experience with database connectivity, object-oriented design, and more.
